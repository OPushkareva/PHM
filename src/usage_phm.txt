phm:
  Pairwise Hierarchical Model
  A Bayesian hierarchical model to map causal interactions between regulatory elements in the genome, that incorporates techniques from Mendelian Randomisation

Usage:
  phm <input file> [OPTIONS]

Input:
  Output of bayesian regression which consists of
  paired peak IDs with Regional Bayes factors for 10 hypotheses.

Output:
  Posterior probability and coefficients for covariates.
  
Mandatory arguments:

  -d/--dimension                 <string>  dimension of the binary input file (e.g., 100,3)
  
Output options:

  -p/--posterior-probability     <string>  File name of posterior probabilities
  -c/--coefficient               <string>  File name of coefficients 
  -b/--binary                              Output as binary files

Other options:

  -t/--n-threads                 <int>     The number of threads used in the E-step
  -v/--verbose                             Print verbose output (for debugging).
